    <h1>Ursula Kroeber Le Guin</h1>
    <p>Ursula Kroeber Le Guin (October 21, 1929 â€“ January 22, 2018) was an American author best known for her works of
        speculative fiction, including science fiction works set in her Hainish universe, and the Earthsea fantasy
        series. She was first published in 1959, and her literary career spanned nearly sixty years, yielding more than
        twenty novels and over a hundred short stories, in addition to poetry, literary criticism, translations, and
        children's books. Frequently described as an author of science fiction, Le Guin has also been called a "major
        voice in American Letters".[2] Le Guin herself said she would prefer to be known as an "American novelist".[3]

        Le Guin was born in Berkeley, California, to author Theodora Kroeber and anthropologist Alfred Louis Kroeber.
        Having earned a master's degree in French, Le Guin began doctoral studies but abandoned these after her marriage
        in 1953 to historian Charles Le Guin. She began writing full-time in the late 1950s and achieved major critical
        and commercial success with A Wizard of Earthsea (1968) and The Left Hand of Darkness (1969), which have been
        described by Harold Bloom as her masterpieces.[4] For the latter volume, Le Guin won both the Hugo and Nebula
        awards for best novel, becoming the first woman to do so. Several more works set in Earthsea or the Hainish
        universe followed; others included books set in the fictional country of Orsinia, several works for children,
        and many anthologies.</p>
